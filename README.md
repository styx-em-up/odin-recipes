html beginner project for The Odin Project
I'm demonstrating in this project that i can, with html:
-Do headings
-Insert image links (a relative one and an absolute one)
-Insert site links (relative ones, in this case)
-Make unordered and ordered lists
The project is also good to start getting to use the git commands "add", "commit", "status", "log"
